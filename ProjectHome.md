During my APT research I realized that a lot of the attacks used free, closed source RAT's that normally are seen as "skidware".

These reverse connect tools are easily firewall-blocked based on port, and I decided to see could I implement a remote admin tool by using UmbraLoaders "Plugin" functionality as an academic exercise.
